## Participation through the years 🗓

### Outreachy 2022 - December Cohort

Zarr participated in Outreachy 2022 for the first time. After reviewing several applications, we shortlisted two contributors to work with us for December 2022 Cohort. They are:

- [BRANDON AWA](https://github.com/DON-BRAN) for Creating Tutorials for Zarr
- [Weddy Gikunda](https://github.com/caviere) for Testing the support and interoperability of Zarr Zip Stores

Both these contributors are being mentored by [Josh Moore](https://github.com/joshmoore) and [Sanket Verma](https://github.com/MSanKeys963).
